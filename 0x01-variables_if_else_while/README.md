# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while
## Requirements
### General
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pendantic -std=gnu89`
* All files ends with a new line
* The README contains the description of all tasks in the project
* There are no errors or warnings during compilation
* `system` is not used
* The codes uses betty style
## Description
The C programs can be compiled using
```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 [c-filename-here] && ./a.out
```
* This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable `n` is positive or negative:
    * **[0-positive_or_negative.c](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c)**
* This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `n`:
    * **[1-last_digit.c](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c)**
* Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line:
    * **[2-print_alphabet.c](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/2-print_alphabet.c)**
* Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line:
    * **[3-print_alphabets.c](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/3-print_alphabets.c)**
* Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line:
    * **[4-print_alphabt.c](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/4-print_alphabt.c)**
* Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line:
    * **[5-print_numbers.c](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/5-print_numbers.c)**
* Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line:
    * **[6-print_numberz.c](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/6-print_numberz.c)**
* Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line:
    * **[7-print_tebahpla.c](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/7-print_tebahpla.c)**
* Write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line:
    * **[8-print_base16.c](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/8-print_base16.c)**
* Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers:
    * **[9-print_comb.c](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/9-print_comb.c)**
* Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits:
    * **[100-print_comb3.c](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/100-print_comb3.c)**
* Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits:
    * **[101-print_comb4.c](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/101-print_comb4.c)**
* Write a program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers:
    * **[102-print_comb5.c](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/102-print_comb5.c)**
