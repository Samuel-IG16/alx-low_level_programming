# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops
## Requirements
### General
* Allowed eiditors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pendantic -std=gnu89`
* All files ends with a new line
* The README contains the description of all tasks in the project
* The codes uses betty style
* No global variables were used
* No standard library functions were used e.g `printf`, `puts`, etc.
* Allowed to used use [_putchar](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c)
* The prototypes of all functions is included the header file called `main.h`
## Description
The C programs can be compiled using the examples files
```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 [c-filename-here] && ./a.out
```
* Write a function that checks for uppercase character:
    * **[0-isupper.c](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/0-isupper.c)**
* Write a function that checks for a digit (`0` through `9`):
    * **[1-isdigit.c](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/1-isdigit.c)**
* Write a function that multiplies two integers:
    * **[2-mul.c](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/2-mul.c)**
* Write a function that prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`, followed by a new line:
    * **[3-print_numbers.c](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/3-print_numbers.c)**
* Write a function that prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`, followed by a new line. Do not print `2` and `4`:
    * **[4-print_most_numbers.c](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/4-print_most_numbers.c)**
* Write a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from `0` to `14`, followed by a new line:
    * **[5-more_numbers.c](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/5-more_numbers.c)**
* Write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal:
    * **[6-print_line.c](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/6-print_line.c)**
* Write a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal:
    * **[7-print_diagonal.c](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/7-print_diagonal.c)**
* Write a function that prints a square, followed by a new line:
    * **[8-print_square.c](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/8-print_square.c)**
* The “Fizz-Buzz test” is an interview question designed to help filter out the 99.5% of programming job candidates who can’t seem to program their way out of a wet paper bag.
Write a program that prints the numbers from `1` to `100`, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz:
    * **[9-fizz_buzz.c](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/9-fizz_buzz.c)**
* Write a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line:
    * **[10-print_triangle.c](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/10-print_triangle.c)**
* Your program will be compiled with this command
```bash
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 100-prime_factor.c -o 100-prime_factor -lm
```
 
The prime factors of 1231952 are 2, 2, 2, 2, 37 and 2081.
Write a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line:
Your program will be compiled with this command
    * **[100-prime_factor.c](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/100-prime_factor.c)**
* Write a function that prints an integer:
    * **[101-print_number.c](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/101-print_number.c)**
