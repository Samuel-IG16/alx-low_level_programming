# 0x00. C - Hello, World
## Description
What you should learn from this project:

Why C programming is awesome, Who invented C, Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan and Linus Torvalds, What happens when you type `gcc main.c`, What is an entry point, What is `main`, How to print text using `printf`, `puts` and `putchar`, How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator `sizeof`, How to compile using `gcc`, What is the default program name when compiling with `gcc`, What is the official C coding style and how to check your code with `betty-style`, How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function, How does the `main` function influence the return value of the program.

* Write a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file:
    * **[0-preprocessor](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/0-preprocessor)**
* Write a script that compiles a C file but does not link:
    * **[1-compiler](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/1-compiler)**
* Write a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file:

    * **[3-name](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/3-name)**
* Write a C program that prints exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle`, followed by a new line:
    * **[4-puts.c](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/4-puts.c)**
* Write a C program that prints exactly `with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,`, followed by a new line:
    * **[5-printf.c](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/5-printf.c)**
* Write a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on:
    * **[6-size.c](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/6-size.c)**
* Write a script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file:
    * **[100-intel](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/100-intel)**
* Write a C program that prints exactly `and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19`, followed by a new line, to the standard error:
    * **[101-quote.c](https://github.com/Samuel-IG16/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/101-quote.c)**
